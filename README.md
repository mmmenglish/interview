## Problem statement
Ladies will go through an onboarding process when they join Hey Lady. We ask them about their interests, availability, English confidence level, etc. This is really valuable information in terms of matching them to other ladies in the platform with similar interests, availability, etc. 

Here is the [Figma workflow](https://www.figma.com/file/bS6vpOUn5G31ZbqGhEV40w/Hey-Lady!-UI-Deliverables-(Copy)) for the onboarding process.

We also record data about what was the topic of the events that they took part in, who else was in those events, etc. 

## Your mission
Given this information, you will have 3 tasks:
1. Design the architecture of the system component that does the matching and recommends them ladies that they could follow, based on predefined criteria.
2. What other data do you think would be useful to be collected, apart from what is described above?
3. Write a simple matching algorithm based on the interests that the ladies have chosen. Please use Typescript as the language of choice. No need to design a UI for this, but if you decide to do it, please use React and Typescript on the frontend :)
