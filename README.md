## Problem statement
Ladies will go through an onboarding process when they join Hey Lady. We ask them about their interests, availability, English confidence level, etc. This is really valuable information in terms of matching them to other ladies in the platform with similar interests, availability, etc. 

We also record data about what was the topic of the events that they took part in, who else was in those events, etc. 

## Your mission
Given this information, you will have 3 tasks:
1. Design the architecture of the system component that does the matching and recommends them ladies that they could follow, based on predefined criteria.
2. What other criteria do you think would be useful to be collected?
3. Write a simple matching algorithm based on the interests that the ladies have chosen. Please use Typescript as the language of choice.
